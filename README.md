# Drag and Drop Website Builder

This is a basic website builder created using only HTML, CSS, and plain JavaScript. It allows users to drag elements like text, images, and buttons onto a blank canvas and customize their properties through an editor.

## Features

- Drag and drop interface for adding elements to the canvas  
- Edit text content, font size, color, and image URL  
- Move and reposition elements freely  
- Resize images using the property editor  
- Mobile-friendly and responsive design  
- No frameworks or external libraries used

## How It Works

1. Choose an element (Text, Image, or Button) from the left panel.
2. Drag it onto the main canvas area.
3. Click the element to open the property editor on the right.
4. Use the editor to change the content, font size, colors, or image source.
5. You can drag elements again to reposition them.
